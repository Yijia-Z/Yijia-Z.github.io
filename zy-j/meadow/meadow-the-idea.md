## on dialog

hypertextual exchanges will be agnostic. if one has infinite mental/computing capacity, they may process all modals syncronously. this is true for the case of the imminent superintelligence, though we are probably far from approaching that stage. the current intelligence infrastructure allows us to achieve multimodal interactivity, yet human brain is the bottleneck of enabling simultaneity in thinking traces. (thankfully, researches indicates possibility to bootstrap reasoning processes[^1].) while there is a path towards truly independent llm agents, the role of human will remain. after all, whether as a wetware organ of machines or as its own free spirit, an interface is needed for human brain. textual representation already provides enough bandwidth for the current stage of our species' information management. we observe most frutiful and complex intelligence outcome from asyncronous and branching discourses, including:

1. the web connected with hyperlinks,
2. encyclopedias,
3. research publications,
4. specialized forums.

although everything is interconnected, we always find flocculent structures in non-homogeneous mixtures. networks and graphs are a common way to approximate such manifold. simply put, graph based dialogs will be a more efficient way for brain-llm interaction, even in an asi scenario.

## directed acyclic graph

directed acyclic graph may be an optimal abstraction of human dialog in written forms. as time does not revert and past textual references cannot be unsaid, the conversational flow must have directions. this temporal sequence allows repeated access of contexts without forming cycles.
